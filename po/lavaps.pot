"<big>Description</big>\n"
"\n"
"LavaPS is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'', but with a "
"much different attitude.  Rather than presenting lots of specific info in "
"digital form, it tries to present certain important information in a "
"graphical analog form.  The idea is that you can run it in the background "
"and get a rough idea of what's happening to your system without devoting "
"much concentration to the task.\n"
"\n"
"LavaPS was inspired by Mark Weiser's idea of calm computing in this paper:\n"

"*  ``The Coming Age of Calm Technology'' by Mark Weiser and John Seely "

"<big>Controlling Lavaps</big>\n"
"\n"
"Basic LavaPS is quite simple. Blobs live and grow corresponding to processes "
"in the system (see <i>\"BLOBS\"</i>). Clicking the left mouse button on a "
"blob shows information about that process. Clicking the right mouse button "
"pops up menus that let you control LavaPS (see <i>\"MENUS\"</i>). The \"base"
"\" at the bottom of the lamp includes icons for the menus and resizing, and "
"allows one to move the lamp around.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<big>Blobs</big>\n"
"\n"
"LavaPS is all about blobs of virtual, non-toxic lava. Blobs in LavaPS "
"correspond to processes in the system. When a process is started, a new blob "
"is created. When a process exits, the corresponding blob disappears. Blob "
"size is proportional to the amount of memory the process uses. Blob movement "
"is proportional to the amount of time the process runs (if the process never "
"runs, the blob will never move).\n"
"\n"
"Blobs show several things. First, the basic color (the hue) corresponds to "
"the name of the program which is running.  Emacs is always one color, "
"Netscape another (on my system, blue and yellow). Second, blobs get darker "
"when the process doesn't run. Over time, the process will become nearly "
"black and only  its border will remain colored. Finally, if both physical "
"and virtual memory are shown, then the part of the process will be a "
"slightly different color showing what percentage of the process is not in "
"physical memory.\n"
"\n"
"There are some more subtle aspects of blob physiology: initial placement is "
"dependent on the process id (blobs appear roughly left to right) and user id "
"(processes for the same user start at the same height, with root's processes "
"at the top).\n"
"\n"
"Blobs also move along the longer distance of the lamp: if you resize it they "
"may change direction.\n"
"\n"
"Please don't ask me about the chemical composition of the virtual lava.\n"

"<big>Menus</big>\n"
"\n"
"The right mouse button pops up menus which control LavaPS, including:\n"
"\n"
"<b>Proc</b>: control the process under the menu: ``Nice'' it (make it take "
"less CPU), unnice it (the reverse; only works if you're root), or send it a "
"signal. Signals are terminate (the polite way to stop a process; "
"``terminate'' allows it to clean up after itself), kill (the forcefully way "
"to stop something not listening to terminate), stop and continue "
"(temporarily stop and resume the process), and hang-up (used to restart "
"certain processes). Beware that these commands will be disabled if you don't "
"have privileges to run them, and under some circumstances even ``kill'' "
"won't stop a process.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Who</b>: track processes by <i>me</i> or by <i>everyone</i> (including "
"root, httpd, etc.).\n"
"\n"
"<b>What</b>: track process physical or virtual memory or both. Most modern "
"operating systems can keep all of a process in RAM (physical memory), or can "
"let pages that aren't currently used float out to disk (virtual memory). "
"Virtual memory is always a superset of physical memory. You can track either "
"one, or both. When tracking both, virtual memory appears as a different "
"colored strip down the middle of the process blob.\n"
"\n"
"<b>How</b>: general lava lamp details: sizing, speed, and window manager "
"interaction. Putting too little or too much lava in your lava lamp would "
"make it boring or overflow. LavaPS therefore usually runs with patent-"
"pending lava <i>autosizing</i> where blobs fill about a quarter of the lamp. "
"This feature can be turned off (at your peril) with the How menu. You can "
"also control the desired size of the blobs (when autosizing is enabled) or "
"the absolute size of the blobs (when it's not) with the <i>Grow</i> and "
"<i>Shrink</i> options.\n"
"\n"
"Also under How, <i>Jumpier</i> and <i>Smoother</i> control the quality of "
"lavaps animation. The smoother the animation, the higher the CPU overhead of "
"lavaps (because of more frequent scans of the process table). Less smooth is "
"more efficient.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Help</b>: you'll have to figure this one out on your own.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Quit</b>: this one's even harder than Help.\n"

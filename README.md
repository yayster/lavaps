Lavaps by John Heidemann
```
I have always liked this app very much.

However, it is no longer working and I am beginning my quest to make it
functional again.

It maybe easy, it maybe hard.  I do not know.
But I look forward to the day when the bubbles will be floating up and
down the side of the monitor!

I got the source code from the following url:
https://github.com/yayster/lavaps.git

The version of the software is 2.7 from this source.
